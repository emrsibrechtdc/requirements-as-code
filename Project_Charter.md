# AI Development Transformation - Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** AI-Driven Development Transformation Initiative  
**Project Sponsor:** [To be assigned]  
**Project Manager:** [To be assigned]  
**Start Date:** [To be determined]  
**Expected Duration:** 17-26 months  
**Budget:** [To be determined]  

## Business Case

### Current Challenges
- Manual coding processes leading to longer development cycles
- Repetitive boilerplate code creation consuming developer time
- Inconsistent code quality across multiple repositories
- Slow time-to-market for new features and bug fixes
- Limited capacity to handle increasing feature demands

### Proposed Solution
Transform development workflow to leverage AI for code generation based on structured acceptance criteria from DevOps work items.

### Expected Benefits
- **60-80% reduction** in initial code creation time
- **50% faster** time-to-market for new features
- **40% decrease** in production bug rates
- **30-50% reduction** in development costs
- Increased developer satisfaction and productivity

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- All repositories within the current multi-repo architecture
- C# codebase transformation
- Bicep template automation
- Docker containerization improvements
- SQL and NoSQL data store integrations
- YAML pipeline enhancements
- DevOps work item integration

### Out of Scope
- Legacy system migrations (unless specifically identified)
- Third-party vendor integrations (beyond AI services)
- Hardware infrastructure changes
- Non-development team processes

## Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives
1. **Functional AI Code Generation:** Achieve 90% accuracy in generated code for simple tasks by end of Phase 2
2. **Quality Maintenance:** Maintain or improve current code quality scores throughout transformation
3. **Security Compliance:** Zero critical vulnerabilities in AI-generated code
